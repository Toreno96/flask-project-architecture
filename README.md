# Flask Project Architecture

These are experiments with implementing awesome [HackSoftware's Django Styleguide](https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide) in Flask project.

Some solutions (mostly way of using [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)) are also inspired by the great [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).
